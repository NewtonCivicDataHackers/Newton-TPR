  Editor's note—The board of aldermen has passed ordinances creating these additional speed zones.  However, the 
ordinances are not effective until approved by the commonwealth.  As of the date of the 2007 Recodification, no 
approval has been received for the following additions and changes: 

Centre Street, 25 miles per hour from Route 9 overpass to Centre Avenue. (Ord. No. V-145, 10-20-97) 
Cummings Road., 25 miles per hour from Homer Street to end. (Ord. No. X-23, 7-8-02)

Wolcott Street, 25 miles per hour, from Webster Street to Lexington Street. (Ord. No. U-40, 4-19-94) 

In the case of Centre Street, the existing speed zones set out in the main provisions of this section shall continue 
in effect unless the commonwealth approves the change adopted in V-145.  In the event of such approval, the 
existing speed zones shall be considered deleted and the provisions of V-145 shall be in effect.
